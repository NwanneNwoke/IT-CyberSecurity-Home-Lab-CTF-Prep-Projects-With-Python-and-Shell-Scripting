# IT CyberSecurity Home Lab CTF Prep Projects With Python and Shell Scripting

This repository contains a curated set of IT and cybersecurity-focused projects that reflect my hands-on learning, Capture The Flag (CTF) participation, and virtual lab setup experience. These projects demonstrate core skills in networking, systems administration, encryption, and Python developmentâ€”supporting my path toward a cybersecurity career.

## Projects

### 1. HelpDeskAPI
A basic RESTful help desk ticketing system built with Flask.
- Create and view support tickets
- Simulates IT ticket handling workflows
- Run locally using: `python app.py`

### 2. CryptoTool
Simple utility to encrypt messages using Python and the `cryptography` module.
- Generates symmetric keys (Fernet)
- Encrypts messages securely
- Useful for basic cryptography demonstrations and labs

### 3. CTFScript
Basic XOR decryption script written in Python.
- Meant for solving beginner-level XOR CTF challenges
- Easy to modify for hex, base64, or byte shifting problems

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python scripting
- RESTful API development
- Cryptography (Fernet, XOR)
- CTF methodology
- System administration (Ubuntu, Docker)
- Active Directory lab integration
- Participation in CyberForge 2025 (MITRE & Deloitte @ CNU)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download and unzip the folder.
2. Navigate into each project directory.
3. Follow the usage instructions in the respective Python files.
